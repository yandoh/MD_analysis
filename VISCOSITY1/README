Steps in analysis

(1) Calculation of acf for each element of pressure tensor described in .mdmntr file.

  gfortran -fopenmp 1_calc_acf_omp3.f90 -o ../exe/acfPab
  cat *.mdmntr | ../exe/acfPab > result.acf

(2) Integrage acf for non-diagonal part of pressure tensor.

  gfortran 2_integrage_acf.f90 -o ../exe/acfintg
  cat result.acf | ../exe/acfintg > result.intg

Note:
 Long-time tail of acf should be integrated analytically.
