  ./sys_info  ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.
  ./atompairs ... A file which defines atom pairs to be analyzed.
  ./DCD       ... The link to .dcd file concatenated by catdcd.

(2) Calculation of g(r) for each atom pair defined by ./atompairs file.

  gfortran -O3 atomgr_sa.F90 -o ../exe/atomgr
  ln -s (path for .dcd file)/aaa.dcd ./DCD
  ../exe/atomgr > result.gr
