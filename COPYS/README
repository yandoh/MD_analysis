Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input files 

  Create subfolder uner COPYS/, 

    mkdir COPYS/subfolder

  then place the following three files in the subfolder:

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.

  Note: These files are just the same ones used in DCDMOL folder.

(2) Link of converted .dcd file by dcd2moldcd.F90, or dcd2moldcd_catddcd,
    as ./DCD in the subfolder

  Ex) ln -s ../../DCDMOL/Butane/new.dcd ./DCD 

(3) Compile the F90 program, and place executable in exe/ folder

  gfortran -O3 copy_NxNxN.F90 -o ../exe/copynnn

(4) Run analysis in the subfolder 

  ../../exe/copynnn > copied.3x3

  copied.3x3 contains coordinates for mass centers of molecules 
  in a calculation unit cell AND its first neighbor 26 image cells 
  for each flame.

  Note: Output file name and its extension can be decided arbitrarily.
