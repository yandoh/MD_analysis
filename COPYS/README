Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input files 

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.

(2) Link of converted .dcd file by dcd2moldcd.F90 as ./DCD

  Ex) ln -s ../DCDMOL/new.dcd ./DCD 

(3) Run analysis 

  gfortran -O3 copy_NxNxN.F90 -o ../exe/copynnn
  ../exe/copynnn > copied.3x3


  copied.3x3 contains coordinates for mass centers of molecules in a calculation 
  unit cell AND its first neighbor 26 image cells for each flame.
