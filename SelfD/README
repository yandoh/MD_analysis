Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input file

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation.

  ./DCD ... link for .dcd file by catdcd.

(2) Calculation of self diffusion coefficient D.

  gfortran -O3 SelfD_sa.F90 -o ../exe/SelfD
  ln -s (path for .dcd file)/aaa.dcd ./DCD
  ../exe/SelfD > result.selfd
