# Note:
# There are two kinds of programs: 
#  dcd2moldcd.F90         ... a program for .dcd file generated by modylas
#  dcd2moldcd_catdcd.F90  ... a program for .dcd file genereted by catdcd
# This is because binary format in .dcd files by modylas and catdcd is 
# a little different (cell angle information in the header of each flame).


Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input files 

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation.

  ./seginfo.mdff  ... A file which describes segment information
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation with deleting characters "nsegment=",
                      "ID=", and "natom=" in the file.

(2) Link of .dcd file to be converted as ./DCD

  Ex) ln -s npt120K1atm.dcd ./DCD 

(3) Run analysis 

  gfortran -O3 dcd2moldcd.F90 -o ../exe/dcd2moldcd
  ../exe/dcd2moldcd

  or

  gfortran -O3 dcd2moldcd_catdcd.F90 -o ../exe/dcd2moldcd_catdcd
  ../exe/dcd2moldcd_catdcd

  Then, two new files will be generated: new.dcd, last.pdb

  new.dcd ... converted .dcd file where each molecule shape is recovered.
  last.pdb ... pdb file with the last trajectory, used as template for atom                kind information read by VMD.
               e.g.) vmd last.pdb new.dcd
