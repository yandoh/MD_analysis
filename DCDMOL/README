Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input files 

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation.

  ./seginfo.mdff  ... A file which describes segment information
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation with deleting characters "nsegment=",
                      "ID=", and "natom=" in the file.

(2) Link of .dcd file to be converted as ./DCD

  Ex) ln -s npt120K1atm.dcd ./DCD 

(3) Run analysis 

  gfortran -O3 dcd2moldcd.F90 -o ../exe/dcd2moldcd
  ../exe/dcd2moldcd

  Two new files will be generated: new.dcd, last.pdb

  new.dcd ... converted .dcd file where each molecule shape is recovered.
  last.pdb ... pdb file with the last trajectory.
