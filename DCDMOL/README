# Note:
# There are two kinds of programs: 
#  dcd2moldcd.F90         ... a program for .dcd file generated by modylas
#  dcd2moldcd_catdcd.F90  ... a program for .dcd file genereted by catdcd
# This is because binary format in .dcd files by modylas and catdcd is 
# a little different (cell angle information in the header of each flame).


Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input files 

  Create subfolder uner DCDMOL/, 

    mkdir DCDMOL/subfolder

  then place the following three files in the subfolder:

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation.

  ./seginfo.mdff  ... A file which describes segment information
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation with deleting characters "nsegment=",
                      "ID=", and "natom=" in the file.

(2) Link of .dcd file to be converted as ./DCD in the subfolder

  Ex) ln -s npt120K1atm.dcd ./DCD 

(3) Compile the F90 program, and place executable in exe/ folder

    gfortran -O3 dcd2moldcd.F90 -o ../exe/dcd2moldcd

  or

    gfortran -O3 dcd2moldcd_catdcd.F90 -o ../exe/dcd2moldcd_catdcd

(3) Run analysis in the subfolder in the subfolder

    cd DCDMOL/subfolder

    ../../exe/dcd2moldcd

  or

    ../../exe/dcd2moldcd_catdcd

  Then, two new files will be generated in the subfolder: 

  new.dcd ... converted .dcd file where each molecule shape is recovered.

  last.pdb ... pdb file with the last trajectory, used as template for atom                kind information read by VMD.
               e.g.) vmd last.pdb new.dcd
