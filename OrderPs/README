Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input file

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.

  ./DCD      ... link for .dcd file by catdcd.

  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  
                      calculation.

  ./molparts ... A file which describes a series of atom IDs for the atoms
                 constituting a plane segment in a molecule.
                 (i.e., six carbon atoms in a benzene ring)

  ./vectors  ... A file which describes two vectors from which the normal
                 vector to the plnane segment will be calculated. 
                 The vectors are defined by the two pairs of atom IDs.
                 Radial distance with which the nearest neighbor segments
                 is detected is also specified.

(2) Calculation of S for the pair of planes of segments detected 
    in the nearest neighbor solvation shell.

  gfortran -O3 sorder_sa.F90 -o ../exe/sorder
  ln -s (path for .dcd file)/aaa.dcd ./DCD
  ../exe/sorder > result.sod
