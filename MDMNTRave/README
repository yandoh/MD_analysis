Steps in analysis

(1) Prepareation of input file

  ./sys_info ... A file which describes composition of calculation system.
  ./massinfo.mdff ... A file which describes mass information 
                      for each molecule species.
                      This file is extracted from .mdff file used in MD  

(2) Set proper "nline" in averege_mntr.f90

  integer(4),parameter::nline=500000

  "nline" corresponds to number of data lines in .mdmntr without its header.

(3) Take average over .mdmntr files

  gfortran -O3 average_mntr.f90 -o ../exe/avemdmntr
  cat *.mdmntr | ../exe/avemdmntr > mdmntr.ave
